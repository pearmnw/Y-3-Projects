I brought another memory to keep your's inside
I saw us, drown like hightide

Used to date a rapper, but he acted like a diva

Let me put my window down, I need fresh air
We don't want that, we want bars
The reason why we listen to 21 and The Boy
That's what we do in Paris, we don't do Fashion Week
Fashion Week, it's for the last decade, it's not for us
It's about the lights, the lights that we put on in the city
The lights of the Eiffel Tower
I'm in charge of it, I'm the one who's putting it on every day
And you try to flex next, next to me on the red light with your ugly, whatever, flexing, most expensive car, V12
I drive a four-cylinder, I come from nothing, but I'm doing something and you cannot catch my drive
As fast as you try to go, you will never catch me, man

I'm Birdman, that's who I am

Your funeral is finna have like ten caskets on display
One for you, the other nine for everything you're takin' to the grave
You don't play, you don't, you don't, you
You don't play no games

Only thing really worth chasing is a dream
People don't know we play roles on screen

Clean as I can
All weapons formed against me gotta jam

Look
Long way from sentimental
Meet Thomazzo and Ernesto
Short rigatoni with the pesto
These verses are my manifesto
Hallways got an echo
Me and Smigs on the loose in the city, you know how the rest go
Casual sex, I'm like, ""Fuck a dress code""
The first martini is an espresso
Chill shot glasses with prosecco
Niggas so ignorant in our hood, they be like, ""Why the fuck you makin' techno?""
I'm worldwide and this is just another cargo jet flow, I had to let go
Life insurance policies, you niggas 'bout to need the gecko
I got some meaner threats, though
Me, Spider-Man, and Leonardo, I'm back tomorrow
I had the chopper to a wedding out in Monaco or Monte Carlo
I'm losin' track of where we all go

For your birthday, your boyfriend got a party bus
Bottle signs, club lines, should've come with us
We left that shit in '09 when we was comin' up
I mean, these just my suggestions of course
I'm ridin' here fresh off divorce
And I'm tryna look in her eyes, maybe express my remorse
If she want a rebound with me, I'm down to go get her some boards
I'm here for the moral support
Whippin' the Vespa off of six tequilas
Big Benjamins like the Pittsburgh Steelers
Drake, you got it
Robert Kraft sent the jet for us, that shit was patriotic
You would think we live in Baltimore, the way they ravin' 'bout the latest product
Teachin' niggas how to mind they business, and my latest stuff
Might be the only teacher that gets paid enough
That's why I'm in Hyde Park buyin' like half of Harrods
You niggas are too concerned with makin' sure y'all outfits gon' match in Paris
If we don't like you, you payin' tax and tariffs
Come to the 6 and I'm like the actin' sheriff, deputy
First got to America, niggas wouldn't check for me
No chance the kid'll make it here like vasectomy
They underestimated my trajectory
But now they gotta pay that shit direct to me
I send the label bills, bills, bills like the other two women standing next to Bey, that shit was just—
Independent women is lovin' the new appearance
Matter of time before I go net a Bey like a Paris
Like, ""Honey, you gotta know that I never wore Mike Amiris or never hopped in a Urus""
I got my head in the clouds, I'm serious
The lyrics begin to reveal themselves over time periods
Promise you'll get that shit when the sky clears
This shit designed for divine ears
My favorite two words from you white boys is, ""Sign here""
And then comes the sound of glass clinkin' from a wine cheers
Swear I'm pocket checkin' y'all for five years
And then we 'bout to kick this shit in high gear
Eight karats like vegetarians, nigga, the earrings are droopy
Contract Lord of the Rings, think it's a script for the movie
Shout out TVGUCCI, my cousin is spooky
I swear you don't even mean what y'all say like y'all dubbin' a movie
Sidebar, Serena, your husband a groupie
He claim we don't got a problem but
No, boo, it is like you comin' for sushi
We might pop up on 'em at will like Suzuki
Kawasaki, sushi, saké, the money grow on trees like shiitake
They tried to get spicy with me, so I wonder how they gon' stop me
I'm really on a roll like hamachi
The fuck would y'all really do without me?
For your birthday, your man got a table at Hibachi
Last time I ate there, Wayne was doin' numbers off the cup like Yahtzee
And Paris Hilton was steady duckin' the paparazzi
Quavo might've sent me a song that he called ""Versace""
I really can't remember it properly
All I know is that God got me, I'm sittin' on large properties
Treat me like a newborn, Lucian not droppin' me
I'm goin' Pink Floyd, you niggas cannot rock with me
She could be givin' me head and somehow you not toppin' me
Niggas see the 6ix God pass, they high-fivin' me
Need to be high-sixin' me
Swear niggas highkey sick of me
They wifey on my head 'cause I vibe differently
Feel like an AMBER Alert the way that I can take her to the mall and she find Tiffany
I'm like a cup holder the way that these dimes stick to me
They should've been in the fountain based on what y'all wishin' me
Know what I'm sayin'?

We look down and we'll be down, but we stayin' up
And we rise up, we stay on 'em, you heard me? (Ball, ball, ball, ball, ball)

Baptize a nigga, send him home in a blanket
Upgrade a bitch and put some diamonds in her anklet
Better not get no throw up on my seat, I know you drinkin'

Know it'll be a different kind
Shout out to the people workin' nine to five
I be workin' nine to nine
And the six upside down, it's a nine
You already know the vibe
And they leave 'cause of pride, but they comin' back every time
The devils that I recognize, most of them got pretty eyes
Titties and some plans of just gettin' by, that's the way they live or die
Easy to judge, but, girl, who am I?
Truth or dare, I'ma take a double dare
Truth is a suicide
I would rather live a lie, keep you on the outside
Introduce you to the guys
Have you throwin' up the south side like you're one of mine
But you're not one of mine
You belong to everybody else when you're bored in your free time
Shit could make a thug cry, play it like a tough guy
Couldn't even land in the Hamptons, they didn't have the stairs for the shit I fly
Swear it's like a metaphor, I can't even get down from the shit I climb
Can't even get down from the shit I climb

Make me tell you one time
We was on the front line, shit was in my bloodline
Waitin' for the sunshine
But the sun never shines on me, on me
Sleepin' in the whip sometimes, girl, I was sleepin' upright
Henny, red cup life, broski kept it tucked tight
Niggas talkin' bare shit about what they gon' do to mine
Aw, now their tongues tied
We was smokin', watched the sun climb
I would trap until my thumbs cried
Tryna change it all in one line
Never seen a thug cry
Love, it's been a long time
Bet you never seen a thug cry
Hit me on my hotline
And no, ma, I'm not fine at all

I listen a lot but I don't speak much
I kept it brief, she think that I'm shy
She's down for the cause, I told her I'm done
She said she want more, I brang in my guy
I was dead broke, I had no hope
I sat and I thought 'bout ending my life

I got up like a man and I said I'm alright
I got on my grind, didn't make excuses
Stayed in the trap, got hot, got humid

If I don't do it then someone gon' do it
Trusted the man and he done me like Judas

Trust in the government but they all clueless

It's deep, she thought I was stayin'
Fuck, I just lived up to the stereotype that we're all the same, shame
Uh, she wanna get slapped in the face, uh
I'm afraid it's a bit too kinky, and I'm not tryna catch me a case
Say what I want, you don't have to relate
Unlike most of these artists that's lyin', I'm actually paid
I don't want aftermarket diamonds, man, I want factory made
OGs need to get back to reality
I don't wanna hear about back in the day
Go on the 'net, all I hear is ""Cench""
I don't wanna hear them chattin' my name
All of these guys try cat the campaign
I feel like Usher, I trap in the rain
Been through a lot, I can handle the fame
I waste no time gettin' straight back to it (back to it, back to it)
""You need to remember, brother, yeah
First they love you, then they hate you
Then they love you again""
(Can't waste no time, get straight back to it)
""And when you come up you're off
You know you can't do no wrong
You know you're golden boy
And then they start tryna slowly find chinks in your armor
And things to tear you down""

I'll say with it chest, but I know some things locked in, I prefer not to say
I fucked up, I'm admittin' it
I got no ego, I got no shame
I swallow my pride and say that I'm missin' it

And thief from the kids that are privileged, uh
Stolen clothes with a rip in it
Also a stolen phone, no sim in it

No charity work tryna write off tax
Feds got me on a driving ban
In the passenger seat 'til my license back, uh
Ghost and fly off the map, uh

I get some sort of survivors guilt
When I see YM's still supplying crack
This life don't come with retiring plans
It'll come to an end in unfortunate ways
No such thing as positive thinkin'
When you're locked in, it feel like a maze

Got free Wi-Fi, they ain't got 4G

I show respect where it's due
Where would I be if I never met YBeeez?

Kane or Dev, Stormz, Hus, Dave
A couple of names, even DBE

When you need a handout, you don't get help
Why do you all wanna help? I ain't even in need
Had one score for an hour of studio time, I couldn't even lease the beat
Do not disturb me when I'm recordin'

They already know I can rap, the mandem trap, I can do that too
I-I picked up the phone, I heard some terrible news that'll ruin your mood
They made some change and forgot their roots
I made some change and picked up the young Gs
Took them shoppin' and copped them shoes
This hoe forgot she got fucked
You need a reminder you're not brand new
I should've kicked that one to the curb
There and then, but I'm not that rude
Had-had some hoes back when I was broke
They wanna come home, but I got no room
So many years I slept on the sofa
They don't know the half, they got no clue

I took that shot and I followed it through
Don't worry 'bout hollerin' chicks
Get rich, they'll switch and holla at you

I can't get rid of my demons, all of my feelings, I kept inside
I'd never sell my soul or switch on bro in desperate times
My angel there on my shoulder tellin' me, ""No""
I'm bipolar, no Jekyll and Hyde
I gotta think twice what come out my mouth these days 'cause I know I got a voice
I'm the head of my family now, I gotta get in my bag, I got no choice
I'm bait, I gotta roll safe, there's a few places that I'd rather avoid
I made it, I might have a baby, I don't mind a daughter, I'd rather a boy
Bro-bro could've went pro in the field, but he broke his Achilles heel

Just the way that it goes
I can't judge them when it made me dough

Drop that pride when you chat to man
Fuck the street, might frame you in
I'll tell you straight and say how it is
I'll tell you once, won't say it again

Okay, and grandad always told me that
Patience is a virtue
You, you stay silent and then you come later
Fifty grand for the club appearance
Remember they ain't let us inside clubs
Just put a lot of work in, now I deserve a break, I'm takin' some time off
My girl no birth control, if I nut inside, she'll be preggers for nine months
I ain't got the vaccine, still on the street like I don't mind gettin' the virus
We been through worse, bitches third, money second, family first
Think before you speak, say how you feel, stand on it firm
I created a lane, runnin' the game
One hundred a day, no calories burned
Mum, you ain't gotta work no more
One show's two times what you annually earn
Bro, you ain't gotta trap no more
It's 'bout time that we think outside of the box
Tried workin' and I applied for a job
They ain't hirin', so I made ties with the boss
I'm workin', right outside mumzy's house I'm servin'
Same way my bro got locked, I'm nervous (I'm nervous)
If the jakes roll on the block, it's curtains
We ain't got nothin' in common
Came in the game, the bag my objective
All of the fame just came as an extra
My young boy wanna play with the presser (presser)
He don't wanna stay in his lecture
The new world order's amongst us
Look at the ads on the phone that are poppin' up
Really and truly I should've done fraud
But back in the day the trap was popular
She said a trap boy's her type (her type)
But she don't know what it consist of
I ain't your type if when I got clients
Bellin' the line you're pissed off
Patience, gotta have patience
Sittin' in traffic all day give me road rage
I saw a rack, it was love at first sight
Me and the lizzy are soulmates
Man of the moment, I stick to the program
Put down her phone if she talkin' 'bout romance
Although I'm grown, I'm still makin' a snowman (burr)
I got a cold heart, I can't hold hands
My life in the hood soon come to an end
Bitch, it's the end of the beginning
A lot of man pretendin' with the image
Said she didn't wanna let me hit, I wouldn't hit it though
Ain't nobody get me to a milli', uh
If I'm with the guys, we don't need a bodyguard
Cah ain't nobody gonna act silly
The darg gon' bark like a XL bully
I don't beef anybody, if I did, it'd beat the taxman
I don't dress for Halloween, but if I did, I'd be the Batman
Lay her on her belly when I hit her with the backstrokes
See the way I chop it, would've thought I had a black belt
I don't even need practice, I'm a natural
I wanna hit Tennessee, and I don't mean Nashville
When you go through the things we've seen
You'll grow a lil' faster and look at life different
Sometimes I feel like throwin' away my phone and just goin' missin'
Fourteen years old, kicked out of the crib when I went Danielle's for Christmas
Lost time with my mum that I can't get back
And that's why I been rekindlin'
When I was in school just fiddlin'
My teacher never would've thought I'd been here
Apartment block with the gym in it
Neighbors lookin' like, ""How does he live here?""
Takin' it slow, I'm on cruise control
But watch when I put it in sixth gear
2021 had 'em all spun
But next year I do a lot more than this year
Like warnings
Mmh
""Warnin' me now 'bout you
'Cause I can't get you out my head
I really feel, yeah
Something's tellin' me that you need to get away now
Away from everyone
And you need to move away
You need to buy a house in the country
Mmh
Yeah, and just have your fuckin' life that you deserve

I know you're almost gone
Hold on, let me in before the day is over

Something we can use to break our fall

Who are we?
Who have we become?
Are we counting sheep until we dissolve?

Do you feel complacent on the outside?
It's so close that I can taste it
Begging you to change, shit, God knows I tried
You got the life you always want?d

Wonder how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom

He don't try at all, though
Younger than my exes but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever

Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist
And we'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every lover known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

Reconnected when we were little bit older
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders

The truth is it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
But after the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
Our past days were the fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)

We tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama
It loves me
And I can't let you go
Your hand prints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor
It's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks

Drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far (don't pretend)
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart (should've known)
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ah
No, nothin' good starts in a getaway car
I was ridin' in a getaway car
I was cryin' in a getaway car
I was dyin' in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car

I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like Belly, Tommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you're out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
Don't make me sick, nigga
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for

Care for me, care for me
Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me
Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look
I was here before all of this
Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this love's got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we start switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?

Above us all the stars are watchin'
There's no place I'd rather be in this world
Your eyes are where I'm lost in
Underneath the chandelier
We're dancin' all alone
There's no reason to hide
What we're feelin' inside
Right now
So baby let's just turn down the lights
And close the door
Oooh I love that dress
But you won't need it anymore
No you won't need it no more
Let's just kiss 'til we're naked, baby

Oooh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
Versace on the floor
Oooh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
I unzip the back to watch it fall
While I kiss your neck and shoulders
No don't be afraid to show it off
I'll be right here ready to hold you
Girl you know you're perfect from
Your head down to your heels
Don't be confused by my smile
'Cause I ain't ever been more for real, for real
