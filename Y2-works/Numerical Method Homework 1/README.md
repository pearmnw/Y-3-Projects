### StudentID: 6388126
### Name: Apichaya Maneewong
### Section: 2

## *Question 1:*
1. Open the code name is *Heron's_method* in the source code file.
2. You should run the code. The program will ask you to type the number of *square root.*
	*The example:* Enter number of square root:
### You must type the number of the *square root* to run the code*
	*The example:* Enter number of square root: 19 (19 is the number of non-perfect square root)
3. The program will receive the number and run the code. Finally, print out the answer.
    *The example:* Step1: 4
		           Step2: 4.375
		           Step3: 4.358928571428571
		           Step4: 4.358898943641365
		           The answer of Heron's method: 4.358898943641365
		           The answer of square root: 4.358898943540674
### *description1:* The program will print the information including the result of calculation step by step, the last result that stop by the *stop criterion (0.005)*, and the answer of the *square root* by the math.sqrt to show comparation.

## *Question 2:*
1. Open the code name is *floating_to_IEE* in the source code file.
2. You should run the code. Then the program will ask you to type the number of the *floating-point number (base-10)*
	*The example:* input your number:
### You must type the number of the *floating-point number (base-10)* to run the code
    *The example:* input your number: 58.5625 (58.5625 is the number of floating-point number (base-10))
3. The program will receive the number and run the code. Finally, print out the answer.
    *The example:* s = 0 (s from sign bit)
                   e = 10000100 (e from exponent)      
                   f = 110101001000... (f from mantissa)
### *description2:* The program will print out the information including ‘s’ is the sign bit part, ‘e’ is the exponent part, and ‘f’ is the mantissa part of the *IEEE-754*

## *Question 3:*
1. Open the code name is *IEEE_to_floating* in the source code file.
2. You should run the code. The program will ask you to type the information of the *IEEE-754*
    *The example:* input s: 
                   input e: 
                   input f: 
### You must type the number of the *IEEE-754(including s from sign bit, e from exponent, and f from mantissa step by step)* to run the code
    *The example:* input s: 0
                   input e: 10000100
                   input f: 110101001000
3. The program will receive the numbers and run the code. Finally, print out the answer.
    *The example:* The decimal floating point number is: 58.5625
### *description3:* The program will print out the *floating point number (base-10)*
